title: "Cloudflare DNS Updater"
description: "Simple Cloudflare DNS Updater script built on v4 of their API that supports multiple domains. It is built with NodeJS standard packages. Mainly built to make Cloudflare IP updating easy as it does not normally support DynDNS by default and provide it within other NodeJS applications. Customizable and easy to use."
